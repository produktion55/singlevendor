User story design: 

General design:
- mobile responsiveness is required.
- Bootstrap aesthethic with mature, professional aesthetic
- Clean, minimalist approach with generous whitespace
- no hero page
- Inter sans Font, a monospaced font for things like Crypto Adresses


First Page users see:

- page is divided into two 50% sections, that are stacked vertically on mobile

first section is for registration/login Form (tabs),
the second section shows the site Logo, site Slogan and some cards that explain the Website features
for registration, an invite code is needed. 

Invite Codes:
there should be a master list of valid invite codes, and i want to track which invite codes generates the most registrations. The site is invite-only.

4. File Storage:
File storage has to be local (on the server), not on cloud storage services like S3


- messages & notifications load with SSE, not websockets.


Footer:
- separated into 4 sections, same footer shows on all pages.
- first section shows:
> Site Title (site name) with the site Slogan
> Contact
> FAQ

the second, third and fourth section is blank for now.

Below the 4 sections is
> a Language toggle
> Theme toggle (white/dark/oled/colorful)
